My name is <strong>Andre Assadi. </strong> I am a software engineer currently studying at UC Santa Cruz for a BS in Computer Science. I learned app development at a young age and published numerous applications that molded my understanding of the development process. From starting a <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hackclub</a> at my High School to tutoring in college, I feel fulfilled when teaching others to code.

          <p> QuickMap is a  feature I worked on in the summer of 2018 & 2019 at 3DR which is currently integrated into BETA SiteScan. The algorithm itself was built using OpenCV and C++. QuickMap uses the SIFT descriptor algorithm to localize keypoints and generate affine warp transformations that neatly align images.</p>
